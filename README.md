# Memory Light Game

**A Simon Says-style memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

---

## Overview

This game challenges players to memorize and repeat increasingly long sequences of button presses, each associated with a unique sound. As players correctly reproduce sequences, the game adds new steps, making it progressively harder. Players can toggle strict mode for additional challenge, and the game tracks progress with a step counter. The game also includes options to start, reset, and restart the sequence.

---

## Features

- Presents a random sequence of button presses with sounds.
- Player repeats the sequence; each successful round adds a new step.
- Plays specific sounds for each button press.
- Provides feedback on incorrect presses.
- Supports strict mode: wrong input resets the game with a new sequence.
- Displays current sequence length.
- Includes start, reset, and strict mode toggle buttons.
- Declares victory after 20 correct steps, then restarts.

## How to Use

1. **Start the game** by clicking the **Start** button.

6. Use the **Strict Mode** toggle to enable or disable strict mode.
7. The **Steps** counter shows the current sequence length.
8. Press **Reset** at any time to restart the game from the beginning.
